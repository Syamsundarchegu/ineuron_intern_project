# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
Internship for Ineuron

## Overview
This classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card Defaulter prediction. 
Prediticion of the next month card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral
data of customers.

## Motivation
There are times when even a seemingly manageable debt, such as credit cards goes out of control. Loss of job, medical
crisis or business failure are some of the reason that can impact your finances. In fact, credit
card debts are usually the first to get of hand in such situation due to hefty finance charges(compounded
on daily balances) and other penalties.

## Dataset Infomation
This dataset contains informaiton on defaultpayments, demographic factors, credit data, history of
payment, and bill statements of credit clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:

  1. Training a RandomForestClassifier classification model to prredict defaulter as accurate as possible.
     
         > Cleaning the datasets, fixing all features
     
         > Apply Classification ML model
  3. Building and hosting a Flask web app on Render.
     
         > Build web app using Flask API
     
         > Upload the project on GitHub
     
         > Get the customer information from Web app
     
         > Display the prediction
## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.12. If you don't have Python installed you can find it
python.org. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package,
ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run
this commond in the project directory after cloning the repository.

## Created a enivronment in vs code terminal
